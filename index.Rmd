## What you need to know

Think about 2 things:

1. A place you like and go there to find the coordinates of it!
2. It's obvious you know the name of this place, right!? If not, USE YOUR IMAGINATION!!!!

## Follow the steps

1. Look at the map, isn't it beautiful?!
2. Sorry, look at the tab About.
3. After that I think you are smart enough to know how to use! =)

## Just kidding...

1. Put the name what you want to see on the popup
2. Put the LATITUDE
3. Put the LONGITUDE
4. Play with the Zoom 
5. Admire the magic!
